NAME
    Test::TempDir::Tiny - Temporary directories that stick around when tests
    fail

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        # t/foo.t
        use Test::More;
        use Test::TempDir::Tiny;

        # default tempdirs
        $dir = tempdir();          # ./tmp/t_foo_t/default_1/
        $dir = tempdir();          # ./tmp/t_foo_t/default_2/

        # labeled tempdirs
        $dir = tempdir("label");   # ./tmp/t_foo_t/label_1/
        $dir = tempdir("label");   # ./tmp/t_foo_t/label_2/

        # labels with spaces and non-word characters
        $dir = tempdir("bar baz")  # ./tmp/t_foo_t/bar_baz_1/
        $dir = tempdir("!!!bang")  # ./tmp/t_foo_t/_bang_1/

DESCRIPTION
    This module works with Test::More to create temporary directories that
    stick around if tests fail.

    It is loosely based on Test::TempDir, but with less complexity, greater
    portability and zero non-core dependencies. (Capture::Tiny is
    recommended for testing.)

    The "tempdir" function is exported by default. When called, it
    constructs a directory tree to hold temporary directories.

    If the current directory is writable, the root for directories will be
    ./tmp. Otherwise, a File::Temp directory will be created wherever
    temporary directories are stored for your system.

    Every *.t file gets its own subdirectory under the root based on the
    test filename, but with slashes and periods replaced with underscores.
    For example, t/foo.t would get a test-file-specific subdirectory
    ./tmp/t_foo_t/. Directories created by "tempdir" get put in that
    directory. This makes it very easy to find files later if tests fail.

    The test-file-specific name is consistent from run-to-run. If an old
    directory already exists, it will be removed.

    When the test file exits, if all tests passed, then the
    test-file-specific directory is recursively removed.

    If a test failed and the root directory is ./tmp, the test-file-specific
    directory sticks around for inspection. (But if the root is a File::Temp
    directory, it is always discarded).

    If nothing is left in ./tmp (i.e. no other test file failed), then ./tmp
    is cleaned up as well.

    This module attempts to avoid race conditions due to parallel testing.
    In extreme cases, the test-file-specific subdirectory might be created
    as a regular File::Temp directory rather than in ./tmp. In such a case,
    a warning will be issued.

FUNCTIONS
  tempdir
        $dir = tempdir();          # .../default_1/
        $dir = tempdir("label");   # .../label_1/

    Creates a directory underneath a test-file-specific temporary directory
    and returns the absolute path to it.

    The function takes a single argument as a label for the directory or
    defaults to "default". An incremental counter value will be appended to
    allow a label to be used within a loop with distinct temporary
    directories:

        # t/foo.t

        for ( 1 .. 3 ) {
            tempdir("in loop");
        }

        # creates:
        #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_1
        #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_2
        #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_3

    If the label contains any characters besides alphanumerics, underscore
    and dash, they will be collapsed and replaced with a single underscore.

        $dir = tempdir("a space"); # .../a_space_1/
        $dir = tempdir("a!bang");  # .../a_bang_1/

    The test-file-specific directory and all directories within it will be
    cleaned up with an END block if the current test file passes tests.
